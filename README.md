# Conclusion
Interpreting student NPS feedback can be a valuable tool for understanding student satisfaction and identifying areas for improvement in educational institutions. This sentiment analysis helps to extract valuable insights from unstructured text data, allowing educators and administrators to make data-driven decisions.
